Three years ago, I accidentally found my true passion: software development. It started as a means to an end, building simple tools to make my life easier. Then the community showed up, asking for features and pointing out bugs. I started learning new things with every app I created or upgraded. Now I can't imagine my life without writing code, so..
<br></br>
<br></br>
I am looking for a job as a software developer either in <span class="text-white">Go</span>, or <span class="text-white">React</span>/<span class="text-white">TypeScript</span>.
      </>}
    ></CardCV>
